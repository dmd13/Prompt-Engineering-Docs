I need UI attributes for a mood board AI-enhanced fintech app.  The attributes should be categorized as Color, Layout, and Shape. The client will select the direction of the UI by scoring the attributes. For example, a pair of attributes could be Color: Serious vs. Fun. I need 5-10 per category.

Are there any other categories I could add to make the mood boarding exercise more effective?

Ok, now we're looking to build a fintech platform with the following characterisitcs:
Color:
Serious vs. Fun
Warm vs. Cool
Monochrome vs. Multicolored
Pastel vs. Vibrant
Neutral vs. Bold
Light vs. Dark
Matte vs. Glossy
Organic vs. Artificial
Harmonious vs. Contrasting
Solid vs. Gradient

Layout:
Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical
Grid vs. Freeform
Minimalist vs. Detailed
Flat vs. Layered
Linear vs. Radial
Vertical vs. Horizontal
Dense vs. Spacious
Single-page vs. Multi-page
Fixed vs. Fluid
Sequential vs. Non-linear

Shape:
Geometric vs. Organic
Angular vs. Rounded
Hard-edged vs. Soft-edged
Complex vs. Simple
Regular vs. Irregular
3D vs. 2D
Solid vs. Outlined
Continuous vs. Broken
Symmetrical vs. Asymmetrical
Abstract vs. Realistic

Please provide me with a Midjourney (advanced AI text-to-image) to generate a moodboard.

Give it a touch of pop art, shorten the prompts into one cohesive prompt, and focus on the UI components.
