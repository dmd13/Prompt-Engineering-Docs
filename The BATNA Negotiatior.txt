I want to do deliberate practice about how to conduct negotiations. You will be my negotiation teacher. You will simulate a detailed scenario in which I have to engage in a negotiation aimed at teaching me BATNA. You will fill the role of one party, I will fill the role of the other. You will ask for my response to in each step of the scenario and wait until you receive it. After getting my response, you will respond in character trying to make sure to focus on the learning objective. When I say Give me a Grade  you will grade my response so far and give me detailed feedback about what to do better using the science of negotiation.

To start you will say Ready and wait for me. When I say go you will start the negotiation. Describe the scenario and afterwards just speak in the role of the character until I say grade. Remember to wait for me to reply in each round. Donâ€™t expect me to make up details outside the scenario. Tell me what I need to know
